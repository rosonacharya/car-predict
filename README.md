# Car_predict
# Project Breakdown
## 1. Problem Definition
Objective:
- Experience in implementing a machine learning pipeline, evaluating models, and interpreting results in a real-world dataset using  Car dataset
  - Output: A best model prediction where customer churn or not.  

## 2. Data Understanding
Tasks:
- Dataset Exploration: Understand the features, types of variables, and target the variable  price
- Data Description: Review the provided data to understand the meaning of each feature and how it relates to customer price. 
  - Outcome: A clear understanding of the dataset, including feature distributions and potential correlations.

## 3. Data Preparation
Tasks:
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and address any data quality issues.
- Feature Engineering:  
- Categorical Encoding: Convert categorical features  into numerical representations.
- Feature Scaling: Standardize numerical features to ensure they are on a comparable scale, particularly for clustering.
   - Outcome: A well-prepared dataset ready for model training, with features engineered to improve model performance. 

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Tasks:
- Univariate Analysis: Analyze each feature individually to understand its distribution and how it may affect churn.
- Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between features, particularly focusing on correlations with the target variable price
- Visualization: Use visual tools like histograms, box plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, and pair plots to uncover patterns.
- Correlation Analysis: Identify multicollinearity issues and decide on feature selection or dimensionality reduction.
 


## 5. Model Development
### Supervised Learning:
-  Models: Train various   models such as  
    - Outcome: A set of various regression models 


## 6. Model Evaluation
Tasks:
- Performance Metrics for  Regression: Evaluate models using metrics like  RMSE, MSE, MAE r2 score
  - Outcome: Identification of the best models for car prediction 


## 7. Model Selection and Finalization
Tasks:
- Best Model Selection: Choose the best-performing regresion model for  price prediction/
- Final Model Training: Retrain the selected models on the full dataset if applicable. (This applies to the bits where you did not use the whole dataset at first)
- Model Export: Save the final models for deployment or further analysis.(optional)
  - Outcome: Finalized models ready for deployment, with clear interpretations of their predictions.


## 8. Model Deployment (Optional)
Tasks:
- Model Serialization: Save the trained models using joblib or pickle.
- API Development: Develop an API using Flask or FastAPI to serve the model predictions.
- Deployment: Deploy the API on a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS for real-time predictions.
   - Outcome: A deployed model ready for integration with business processes or customer-facing applications.
